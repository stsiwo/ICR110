algorithm to print the first 100 Prime number

preconditions:
  - no negative
  - 1 is not prime number
  - 2 is the smallest prime number
  - if a number is divided by divisor (no remainder), the number is not prime number
  
 variables
  - number
  - divisor
  - remainder
  
 initialize:
  - number = 1
  - divisor = 2
  - counter = 0 // to count total 100 
  
 input : N/A
 
 process
 
  while (counter < 100):
    if (numner > 1):
      if (number == 2):
        print number
        increment counter (counter++)
      else:
        for loop from divisor to number (divisor <= i < number)
          if (n % i == 0)
            break; // stop and go next number
          if ((n-1) == 1):
            print number
            increment counter (counter++)
